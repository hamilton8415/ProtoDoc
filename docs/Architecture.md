# System

The MBARI Wave-Energy-Converter is a small point absorber design that includes a 2.6m diamter surface expression, an electro-hydraulic PTO, and a submerged heave-cone device.
The system is moored to the seafloor (typically in 80m of water) through a chain-catenary mooring connected to an anchor. 
The design of this system include a requirement that the system be small enough to be deployed by typical oceanographic research ships and personel.
